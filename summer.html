          I enrolled in my school's <span style="background-color:#ccffd9	"><b>Environmental Science and Biotechnology Summer Research Program.</b></span> However, I was not able to attend as many days as I wanted to even though I was still an official part of the program. Nonetheless, the activities were super fun and they were held by my freshman APES teacher who is super funny and nice. I even got a free metroacard!!
        </p> 
        <p>
          I also had <span style="background-color:#ccffd9"><b>SYEP</b></span> over the summer which limited the amount of days that I could attend the research program. SYEP was uneventful, but fun since all we did was watch movies that address real life issues. I was in the <em><b>Youth Advocacy Group</b></em> where a law student from Fordham instructed me. The program promoted activism and they give you a stipend of $700 at the end!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also went to <span style="background-color:#ccffd9"><b>Cancun and the Cruise Anthem of the Seas</b></span> where the pictures are in the Vacation tab. I went biking, seing dolphins, go karting, indoor skydiving, laser tagging, and eating a lot.

          Since I was a rising junior, I had the option to take <span style="background-color:#d7f9f4"><b>Summer Health</b></span>. I applied and got in which was super exciting because it was all online and I wouldn't have to take health in junior year. I had class from 11:50-1:25, but synchronous classes weren't everyday. This made my schedule pretty free as I could do work whenever I wanted to while having time for something else. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I participated in the <span style="background-color:#d7f9f4"><b>Girls Who Code Summer Immersion Program</b></span>. I learned a lot about <em><b>web development</b></em> and created three projects:
            <ul type="circle">
              <li><a href="https://personal-site-rachelx.glitch.me/" target="_blank">Portfolio</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://buzzfeed-quiz-disney.glitch.me/" target="_blank">Buzzfeed Quiz</a></li>
              <li><a href="https://activist-toolkit-period.glitch.me/" target="_blank">Activist Toolkit</a></li>
            </ul> 
        </p>
        <p>
          I also participated in an <span style="background-color:#d7f9f4"><b>APCS Prep Course</b></span> held by my Intro CS teacher, Mr. Holmes. He taught me the basics of Java and the principles of coding. This was extremely helpful becacuse I didn't take a full year of CS. Without him, I would have been lost for the first two months of APCS!
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout my whole summer, I volunteered at <span style="background-color:#d7f9f4"><b>Shuang Wen</b></span>, a pre-k to 8th grade school as a math tutor. I had two students and it was very fun to teach them! The 5th grader was a more challenging to work with than the 8th grader, but I managed to accomodate to their learning styles.

          Another popular all girls coding camp is <span style="background-color:#e5ecff"><b>Kode With Klossy</b></span>. I participated in their 2 week <em><b>web development program</b></em> and it was very fun. The hours are much longer than GWC (9:45-3:15) so I learned a lot more about Flexbox and Javascript. I've created multiple projects for KWK such as the <a href="https://photo-gallery-project.rachelxiao.repl.co/" target="_blank">photo gallery</a> linked on my vacation page and a <a href="https://herstory.pamelaaa.repl.co/" target="_blank">resource website</a> concerning women.

          <span style="background-color:#e5ecff"><b>The Cooper Union Summer Stem Institute</b></span> provided me with a full scolarship for their <em><b>Climate Change and Data Visualization course</b></em>. We examined climate change and strategies to counteract it while learning coding and data visualizations skills!
