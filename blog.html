    <h4>5/14: AP Chemistry</h4>
      <p>This AP was very stressful as <span style="background-color:#ffcccc">the first question was 25 minutes and the second question with 15 minutes, each with five minutes to submit.</span> I took the test in my dining room because it had the best lighting, wifi, and space for the exam. As a result, no one went to the first floor during my exam at 2:00-2:50. I used Victoria's school iPad to take the test because it was large enough for me to read the questions easily and it could take pictures. <br><br>
      <b>During the exam:</b> I had to log in 30 minutes before my exam was administrated and the wait was nerve-racking. I watched the timer slowly tick down as I lost my mind while watching tiktoks. The test was nothing like the practice... I felt rushed  as the first question went up to K and the second question went up to H. The questions were basic yet complex and my test submitted smoothly and clearly.<br>
      <b>After the exam:</b> I was so relieved that it was over and all of my friends who took the chemistry exam went on Houseparty and discussed the difficulty. Some of my friends' questions went up to the letter L! Overall, we were relieved and thought it wasn't completely terrible.</p>

    <!-- <h4>5/21: AP World History</h4>
      <p>AP World History is not my strong suit, but after studying the material, I realized how interesting history really is. This interest mostly came from <a target="_blank" href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_bOoi0e3L3SJ1xx5TZWHPw">Heimler's History</a> as his review videos prepared me well for the AP. For this exam, I used my laptop because I had to type my DBQ and I did it in my <a href="family.html">sisters'</a> room. Their room has better wifi, a quiet space, and a bigger desk.
      <br><br><b>During the exam:</b> The APWH exam had the same schedule as the AP chem exam. However, the wait time for the exam was much worse. On the previous day, my period arrived, so I had the most painful cramps on exam day. Waiting for the exam was terrible as my cramps distracted me and hurt me so much. But, when the exam began, my stomach hurt less and I was calm. Reading my documents and creating my claims went smoothly, but my prompt was a little crazy: "Evaluate the extent to which the environment and/or the knowledge of the environment affected imperialism, circa 1450-1750." This prompt was weird as there was not a lot of outside evidence or context for it, but I wrote a lot to maximize points and was okay on time. When the timer hit five minutes, I started shaking and writing my final words. The submission also went smoothly!
      <br><b>After the exam:</b> Again, I was so relieved that it was over and all of my friends went on Houseparty to discuss the prompts. We divided into two groups for the two different prompts we got. The other prompt had to do with religious tolerance, which was much easier than mine, so I was upset. There were at least three other prompts, but mine was one of the hardest. I was sad, but just excited that it was over so I can relax.</p>

    <h4>5/24</h4>
      <p>Today was quite uneventful as I only studied a little bit my algebra2 and watched some chemistry videos. But, I was super happy when I figured out how to created the dropdown menu when hovering over the navigation bar. Also, I had chicken for lunch and dinner and it was super good.</p>
      <p>This morning, I realized that my phone was playing a tiktok video for 4 hours straight while i was sleeping, but it didn't use that much battery. Then, I reached for my LED light remote and made it fall through the crack of my matress and the backboard of my bed. At night, I asked my mom to help me get it out, so we pulled my bed out and saw a lot of dust. My mom helped me vacuum the dust and pick throw out papers that fell through before. But after we moved everything back, I realized we didn't even get my remote out...</p>

    <h4>6/1 - 6/12: Intro CS Project</h4>
      <p>I dedicated a lot of time to my CS project that was rather straight foward, yet ambiguous at the same time. I spent a lot of time calling my friends, especially Amanda and Jessica. They kept me motivated throughout the entire project, and I don't think I would've gotten a 95 on the project without them.</p>
      <p>The <b>goal of the project</b> was to create a NetLogo simulation that represented a real world problem that could be tested. It was hard to find a topic, but I ended up creating a simulation about how wind speeds affect pollen. This project was going smoothly until June 10. I saw Daniela's project and it was crazy. It was a great simulation with lot's of code and detail in her info tab. This made me want to step up my game. For the next 48 hours, all I did was the project. I was so stressed out and tried to find new ways to make my project represent real life better while making me info tab sound smart. I had help from Mr. Holmes with some genius code, but it created unexpected bugs. I was so confused... I stared at my code for two hours trying to fix it and nothing was happening. I was so stressed out and sad. I didn't know what to do, but Mr. Holmes saved the day when he offered to take a look at my simulation. He told me that everything looked fine and to request a call from him if I was still unreasonbly stressed. I was so relieved because it was the day that the project was due. He made me realize what a simuation actually is, so I was much happier with my project and submitted it with confidence.</p>

    <h4>5/24 - 6/10: APCS Project</h4>
    <p>For my AP Computer Science class, Eliza and I recreated the arcade game <b>Space Invaders</b>. This is our <a target="_blank" href="https://github.com/rachelxiao907/APCSFinalProject">final project</a> and it took about 2 weeks to finish it. It was very fun to create the game because my teacher taught us a lot about Java and Processing. I was very comfortable with coding the game so I was even able to add extra features that are not in the actual game.</p>
